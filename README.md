This project is a Raspberry Pi-based Smart Rider Safety System designed to enhance motorcycle safety by verifying critical safety conditions before allowing ignition. It  evaluates three key parameters: helmet detection using an IR sensor, alcohol and breath quality monitoring using MQ3 and CO₂ sensors, and drowsiness detection  using OpenCV.
